# Categories of the Entries of BnF Ms. Fr. 640

The anonymous, 16th-century artisanal manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, is comprised of almost 1,000 "entries." In the Making and Knowing Project's [_Secrets of Craft and Nature
in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/), an entry is a unit of text under a title. These include instructions, recipes, descriptions, and observations on a wide range of topics, including casting, painting, and medicine. 

Each entry has been grouped into at least one (and up to three) descriptive categories. These are attributes of each entry `<div>`, and can be extracted from the xml of the manuscript pages.
> For example, `<div id="p004v_1" categories="varnish;arms and armor">` for the entry on fol. 4v, "Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c"

## Percentage of Entries by Category
As can be seen by the bargraph below, "casting" has by far the most entries of any category, followed by "painting" and then "metal process."
