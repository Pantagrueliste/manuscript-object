# Categories of the Entries of BnF Ms. Fr. 640

The anonymous, 16th-century artisanal manuscript, BnF Ms. Fr. 640, is comprised of almost 1,000 "entries." In the Making and Knowing Project's [_Secrets of Craft and Nature
in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640_](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/), an entry is a unit of text under a title. These include instructions, recipes, descriptions, and observations on a wide range of topics, including casting, painting, and medicine. 

Each entry has been grouped into at least one (and up to three) descriptive categories. These are attributes of each entry `<div>`, and can be extracted from the xml of the manuscript pages.
> For example, `<div id="p004v_1" categories="varnish;arms and armor">` for the entry on fol. 4v, "Black varnish for sword guard, bands for trunks, &c"

## Percentage of Entries by Category
As can be seen by the bar graph below, "casting" by far has the most entries of any category, followed by "painting" and then "metal process."

### Raw Data and Generation

This plot is generated by [**context_viz.py**](https://github.com/ronikaufman/manuscript-object/blob/context/context_viz.py) developed by [Roni Kaufman](https://github.com/ronikaufman) in summer 2020 using underlying workflows in [cu-mkp/manuscript-object](https://github.com/cu-mkp/manuscript-object).

The raw data (the xml-encoded transcriptions and translations of the manuscript text) is found in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/ms-xml](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/tree/master/ms-xml). See also the extracted elements and properties in [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/metadata/entry-metadata.csv](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data/blob/master/metadata/entry_metadata.csv).

### Notes and Observations and Why is This Interesting?

- Casting: A large majority of casting recipes supports the theory that this is the author-practitioner's main focus and area of expertise. The casting entries are some of the longest and seen to contain the most first-hand observations and active experimentation.
(add example of an entry with first-person language; recipes with repeated trials of same thing like sands or flies; graph of entry lengths)

- Alchemy: While the manuscript was originally thought to contain alchemical writings, as was common for many "Books of Secrets" in the Renaissance that contained first-hand experimentation, the ditribution of categories shows that "alchemy" is one of the least prevalent categories. In fact, there is only one entry that is "alchemical": [fol. 52r, "The work done in Algiers"](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/52r/f/52r/tl)
